Here is an overview of a hello world Haskell program. 
We define * as the macro from which all other code or macros exist.
    << * >>=
    << a trivial comment >>
    << print a string >>

Now we can define each of the above macros,
beginning with an inconsequential comment!
    << a trivial comment >>=
    -- this is a hello world haskell program

Lastly our program needs to print hello world
    << print a string >>=
    main = putStr "Hello, World!"
