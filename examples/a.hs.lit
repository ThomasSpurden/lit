laa dee dah 

how bout some code
    << I'm a variable >>=
    main = putStr "Hello World!"

lets add another variable
    << I'm a comment >>=
    -- This is the hello world program in haskell

What can we do with variables?
Well basically it allows us to restructure code
from how it's typically written
Here is the final part:
    << * >>=
    << I'm a comment >>
    << I'm a variable >>
