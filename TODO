    with command `lit -h`, error ought to raise
    does css option work (throw error if not found)

Processing
----------
    simplify could be tail recursive
    ^ should be called proseUnify ..
    lookfor HashMap alternative (requires unordered containers)
    clean up pipeline funs

    root is rather inflexible must be " * "
    hacky fix with T.strip in expandParts (consolidate)

Pretty
------
    add in custom tags for lit macros
    test Lang works

lit.cabal
--------

Parse
-----
    titles must be followed by \n
