lookfor HashMap alternative (requires unordered containers)

treat a line of pure ws as part of code chunk, unless followed by title

hacky fix with T.strip in expandParts (consolidate)

add in custom tags for lit macros

lines with spaces (after code chunks) shouldn't show 

titles must be followed by \n
