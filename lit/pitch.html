<p>The goal of <code>lit</code> is to permit a way of writing code, that is easy to read.</p>
<p>Instead of spending several days learning a codebase, a <code>lit</code> file
can be read in minutes.</p>
<p><code>lit</code> files are both code and documentation. This is accomplished with
the use of macros. Macros allow for a code file to be packaged into
labeled chunks, that can be rearranged in any order.</p>
<p>Following some simple rules for macros, <code>lit</code> can reassemble the code file from these macros.
Outside of the macros, anything can be written which serves as the narrative.</p>
